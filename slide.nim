What are we going to be talking about today?
- SAT Solvers
  - Enumerating Versions
- Declarative Parser
  - Feature Blocks
- Some small VSCode improvements:
  - VSCode highlights propagated exceptions
  - Better nimble integration with vscode
- Setup Nimble Action

## Why SAT Solvers?

Traditional greedy solvers make locally optimal choices, often leading to dependency conflicts or suboptimal selections.

"""
  slide:
    column:
      nbText: """
  ## Example Issue:

  - Project A requires B >= 0.1.4 and C <= 0.1.0
  - Project B (version 0.1.4) depends on C (any version)
  - Project C has versions 0.1.0 and 0.2.1


  
    A greedy solver might pick C 0.2.1, breaking Project Aâ€™s constraints
"""

  slide:
    nbText: """
  # SAT Solver Advantage:
  - âœ” Global optimization: Ensures all dependencies are satisfied simultaneously
  - âœ” Backtracking & constraint solving: Finds a valid solution where C 0.1.0 is chosen
  - âœ” Correct & complete solutions: Avoids resolution failures that greedy solvers cannot handle

"""

  slide:
    nbText: """
  # Enumerating Versions: 
  Smarter Dependency Resolution:

  Traditional solvers pick a single version per package upfront, often leading to failures when dependencies are not satisfiable.


  """

  slide: 
    nbText: """
  ## New Approach:
  ğŸ”„ Iterative Version Selection: Instead of failing early, the solver downloads multiple versions and retries when conflicts arise.

"""

  slide:
    nbText: """
  ## How It Works:

  - If a dependency constraint allows any version, we fetch multiple versions
  - If the first attempted solution fails, we backtrack and try another version
  - This increases the chance of finding a valid solution automatically

"""

  slide:
    nbText: """
  ## Example:
  
  - A package requires B 0.1.4, which depends on C (any version)
  - If picking C 0.2.1 fails, the solver automatically tries C 0.1.0
  - The solver adapts dynamically to available versions, reducing resolution failures

"""

  slide:
    nbText: """
  ## Advantages:
  - âœ” More robust package resolution
  - âœ” Fewer manual fixes needed
  - âœ” Improved user experience

  ## Declarative Parser 
  
  - ğŸš€ New in Nimble 0.18.0 
  - Enable with `--parser:declarative`
  - ğŸ”œ Will become the default parser in future versions

  ## Conditional Dependencies with feature blocks

  - Supports optional dependencies
  - Avoids unnecessary packages when not needed

  A library supporting both asyncdispatch and chronos:
